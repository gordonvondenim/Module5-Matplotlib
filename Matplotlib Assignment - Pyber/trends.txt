Three Noticeable Trends:
1. Correlation Between fare & supply of drivers - There appears to be some form of correlation between average fare and
   supply of drivers in a given city type. Rural has the highest average fares and the least amount of drivers. On the other hand urban has
   the most amount of drivers and lower average fares.
2. Supply and Demand/Urban - The supply of drivers in the urban market (relative to total drivers) seems to be greater than the urban demand of
   rides (relative to total rides). One could conclude that urban drivers are either often part time or do not receive their 'fair share'.
3. Supply and Revenue/Suburban - Despite only accounting for 16% of the total driver market, surburban drivers bring in over 30% of
   total fares. One could assume that suburban drivers take longer trips than urban. As a result, they probablu make more per rider as well.
